## ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Architecture Refactoring

### **Backend-Agnostic Architecture** (COMPLETED)
Successfully refactored the entire codebase to remove all backend-specific hard-coding. The UI layer is now completely agnostic and works with any backend type.

**Completed Fixes:**
- [x] Removed all "plex" string literals from UI code
- [x] Removed hard-coded movie/TV show assumptions from UI
- [x] Made cache manager backend-agnostic (uses dynamic backend IDs)
- [x] Store libraries in AppState with backend ID association
- [x] Made sync manager work with any backend generically
- [x] Updated all UI components to work with generic library data
- [x] Removed hard-coded library type filtering in sync
- [x] Store and load last active backend ID persistently
- [x] Support multiple backends of same type with unique IDs

**Completed Refactoring Tasks:**
1. [x] **AppState Refactoring**
   - [x] Added `libraries: HashMap<String, Vec<Library>>` to AppState
   - [x] Added `library_items: HashMap<String, Vec<MediaItem>>` for cached items
   - [x] Added methods to get libraries for active backend
   - [x] Added methods to get items for a specific library
   - [x] Added method to get active backend ID

2. [x] **Cache Manager Refactoring**
   - [x] Uses backend IDs dynamically instead of hard-coded "plex"
   - [x] Created generic cache keys: `{backend_id}:{type}:{id}`
   - [x] Supports multiple backends in same cache

3. [x] **Sync Manager Refactoring**
   - [x] Removed all hard-coded "plex" references
   - [x] Uses active backend from AppState
   - [x] Supports syncing any library type (Movies, Shows, Music, Photos)
   - [x] Generic `sync_library_items` method for all media types

4. [x] **UI Components Refactoring**
   - [x] Library list is completely generic
   - [x] Displays ALL library types from backend
   - [x] Uses library type from backend data, not hard-coded
   - [x] Removed PlexBackend downcasting - uses generic backend info

5. [x] **Backend Info System**
   - [x] Added `BackendInfo` struct with server details
   - [x] Added `get_backend_info()` to MediaBackend trait
   - [x] UI uses generic backend info instead of type-specific methods

6. [x] **Persistent Backend Management**
   - [x] Added RuntimeConfig to store last active backend
   - [x] Automatically loads last used backend on startup
   - [x] Generates unique backend IDs (plex, plex_1, plex_2, etc.)

7. [x] **Instant Cache Loading**
   - [x] Cache loads immediately on app startup
   - [x] Welcome UI hidden as soon as cached data is available
   - [x] Authentication happens in background without blocking UI

### **Architecture Principles to Enforce:**
1. **Backend Agnostic UI**: The UI layer should NEVER import or reference specific backend implementations
2. **Generic Data Flow**: UI ‚Üí AppState ‚Üí BackendManager ‚Üí Active Backend
3. **Dynamic Backend Selection**: Support multiple backends simultaneously with runtime switching
4. **Universal Caching**: Cache should work identically for all backends
5. **Type Safety**: Use the MediaBackend trait exclusively in UI/services

### **Example of Correct Architecture:**
```
// BAD - UI knows about Plex
window.sync_and_update_libraries("plex", backend)

// GOOD - UI uses active backend
let backend_id = state.backend_manager.get_active_id();
window.sync_and_update_libraries(backend_id, backend)
```

  - **Problem**: Green bars/incorrect colors appear when subtitles are displayed
  - **Attempted Fixes**:
    - Implemented video-filter for RGBA conversion
    - Added glsinkbin wrapper for GL handling  
    - Used videoconvertscale for optimized conversion
    - Fell back to regular playbin from playbin3
  - **Current State**: Issue persists, appears to be YUV‚ÜíRGB conversion problem during subtitle compositing
  - **Workaround**: Users can disable subtitles or use MPV player backend
- [ ] **MPV Integration Issue (CRITICAL)**: 
  - **Status**: MPV renders successfully but video is BLACK
  - **Problem**: Video frames render but don't display in GLArea widget
  - **Completed Solutions**:
    1. ‚úÖ Use eglGetProcAddress instead of dlsym - Fixed initialization
    2. ‚úÖ Check GL state before/after render (glGetError) - No errors now
    3. ‚úÖ Added glFlush/glFinish after render - Ensures GL commands execute
    4. ‚úÖ Fixed GL_INVALID_FRAMEBUFFER_OPERATION error
    5. ‚úÖ Fixed segmentation faults with proper timing
  - **Current State**:
    - MPV initializes successfully
    - Video loads and dimensions are correct (1918x802)
    - mpv_render_context_render() succeeds continuously

## MPV Render API Integration Plan

### Problem Statement
The current MPV player implementation uses `dmabuf-wayland` output driver which creates its own separate window instead of embedding video into the GTK widget. This is due to Wayland's security model which doesn't allow direct window embedding like X11.

### Solution: MPV Render API with GTK4 GLArea

The proper approach is to use MPV's render API (`libmpv_render`) to draw video frames directly into a GTK4 GLArea widget. This provides true embedding and full control over the video rendering surface.

### Implementation Steps

#### Phase 1: Dependencies & Setup
- [ ] **Update Cargo.toml dependencies**
  - [ ] Check if libmpv2 crate supports render API (if not, may need libmpv-sys or custom bindings)
  - [ ] Add gtk4-rs GLArea support dependencies if needed
  - [ ] Ensure OpenGL/EGL dependencies are available

#### Phase 2: Create GLArea-based Video Widget
- [ ] **Create new `mpv_gl_player.rs` module**
  - [ ] Implement GTK4 GLArea widget wrapper
  - [ ] Set up OpenGL context initialization
  - [ ] Handle widget realize/unrealize signals
  - [ ] Implement proper cleanup on widget destruction

#### Phase 3: MPV Render Context Integration
- [ ] **Initialize MPV with render API**
  - [ ] Create MPV instance with `vo=libmpv` instead of output drivers
  - [ ] Create render context with OpenGL backend
  - [ ] Get OpenGL proc address function from GTK GLArea
  - [ ] Initialize render context with GL context from widget

#### Phase 4: Rendering Pipeline
- [ ] **Implement render loop**
  - [ ] Connect to GLArea's `render` signal
  - [ ] Call `mpv_render_context_render()` in render callback
  - [ ] Handle render updates from MPV
  - [ ] Implement proper frame timing and vsync

#### Phase 5: Event Handling
- [ ] **Handle MPV render events**
  - [ ] Set up wakeup callback for render updates
  - [ ] Handle MPV_EVENT_VIDEO_RECONFIG for size changes
  - [ ] Properly queue widget redraws when new frames available
  - [ ] Handle OpenGL context loss/recreation

#### Phase 6: Migration & Testing
- [ ] **Migrate existing functionality**
  - [ ] Port all playback controls to new implementation
  - [ ] Ensure audio/subtitle track selection works
  - [ ] Test seek functionality
  - [ ] Verify proper cleanup on player destruction
- [ ] **Testing**
  - [ ] Test on Wayland session
  - [ ] Test on X11/XWayland for compatibility
  - [ ] Test with various video formats and codecs
  - [ ] Verify hardware acceleration works

### Technical Details

#### Key Components:
1. **GTK4 GLArea Widget**: Provides OpenGL context for rendering
2. **MPV Render API**: `mpv_render_context` for GPU-accelerated rendering
3. **OpenGL Backend**: Uses EGL/OpenGL for hardware acceleration
4. **Frame Callback System**: Proper synchronization between MPV and GTK

#### Code Structure:
```rust
// Pseudo-code structure
pub struct MpvGLPlayer {
    mpv: Mpv,
    render_context: MpvRenderContext,
    gl_area: gtk4::GLArea,
    // ... other fields
}

impl MpvGLPlayer {
    pub fn new() -> Result<Self> {
        // 1. Create GLArea widget
        // 2. Initialize MPV with vo=libmpv
        // 3. Create render context on widget realize
        // 4. Connect render signals
    }
    
    fn on_gl_realize(&self) {
        // Initialize OpenGL context
        // Create MPV render context
    }
    
    fn on_gl_render(&self) -> bool {
        // Call mpv_render_context_render()
        // Return true to stop other handlers
    }
}
```

#### Key Challenges:
- OpenGL context management between GTK and MPV
- Proper synchronization of render updates
- Handling context loss (GPU reset, suspend/resume)
- Ensuring proper cleanup to avoid GPU memory leaks

### Alternative Approaches (if render API fails)
1. **GStreamer with mpv sink**: Use GStreamer pipeline with custom MPV sink
2. **Texture sharing**: Use dmabuf texture sharing between MPV and GTK
3. **Fallback to GStreamer**: Keep GStreamer as primary, MPV as optional

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Video renders inside GTK widget (not separate window)
- [ ] Smooth playback without tearing
- [ ] Hardware acceleration working
- [ ] All existing player features functional
- [ ] No memory/GPU resource leaks
- [ ] Works on both Wayland and X11
