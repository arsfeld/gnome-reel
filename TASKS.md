## ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Architecture Refactoring

### **Backend-Agnostic Architecture** (COMPLETED)
Successfully refactored the entire codebase to remove all backend-specific hard-coding. The UI layer is now completely agnostic and works with any backend type.

**Completed Fixes:**
- [x] Removed all "plex" string literals from UI code
- [x] Removed hard-coded movie/TV show assumptions from UI
- [x] Made cache manager backend-agnostic (uses dynamic backend IDs)
- [x] Store libraries in AppState with backend ID association
- [x] Made sync manager work with any backend generically
- [x] Updated all UI components to work with generic library data
- [x] Removed hard-coded library type filtering in sync
- [x] Store and load last active backend ID persistently
- [x] Support multiple backends of same type with unique IDs

**Completed Refactoring Tasks:**
1. [x] **AppState Refactoring**
   - [x] Added `libraries: HashMap<String, Vec<Library>>` to AppState
   - [x] Added `library_items: HashMap<String, Vec<MediaItem>>` for cached items
   - [x] Added methods to get libraries for active backend
   - [x] Added methods to get items for a specific library
   - [x] Added method to get active backend ID

2. [x] **Cache Manager Refactoring**
   - [x] Uses backend IDs dynamically instead of hard-coded "plex"
   - [x] Created generic cache keys: `{backend_id}:{type}:{id}`
   - [x] Supports multiple backends in same cache

3. [x] **Sync Manager Refactoring**
   - [x] Removed all hard-coded "plex" references
   - [x] Uses active backend from AppState
   - [x] Supports syncing any library type (Movies, Shows, Music, Photos)
   - [x] Generic `sync_library_items` method for all media types

4. [x] **UI Components Refactoring**
   - [x] Library list is completely generic
   - [x] Displays ALL library types from backend
   - [x] Uses library type from backend data, not hard-coded
   - [x] Removed PlexBackend downcasting - uses generic backend info

5. [x] **Backend Info System**
   - [x] Added `BackendInfo` struct with server details
   - [x] Added `get_backend_info()` to MediaBackend trait
   - [x] UI uses generic backend info instead of type-specific methods

6. [x] **Persistent Backend Management**
   - [x] Added RuntimeConfig to store last active backend
   - [x] Automatically loads last used backend on startup
   - [x] Generates unique backend IDs (plex, plex_1, plex_2, etc.)

7. [x] **Instant Cache Loading**
   - [x] Cache loads immediately on app startup
   - [x] Welcome UI hidden as soon as cached data is available
   - [x] Authentication happens in background without blocking UI

### **Architecture Principles to Enforce:**
1. **Backend Agnostic UI**: The UI layer should NEVER import or reference specific backend implementations
2. **Generic Data Flow**: UI ‚Üí AppState ‚Üí BackendManager ‚Üí Active Backend
3. **Dynamic Backend Selection**: Support multiple backends simultaneously with runtime switching
4. **Universal Caching**: Cache should work identically for all backends
5. **Type Safety**: Use the MediaBackend trait exclusively in UI/services

### **Example of Correct Architecture:**
```
// BAD - UI knows about Plex
window.sync_and_update_libraries("plex", backend)

// GOOD - UI uses active backend
let backend_id = state.backend_manager.get_active_id();
window.sync_and_update_libraries(backend_id, backend)
```
